1. In the Matches sheet, some column were removed due to the fact that we don't really need them and a column was also added, which is the column for home and away win was created using the one of the Excel function = IFS (Home team goal> Away, "H", Home team goal < Away team goal, "A", Home team goal = Away team goal, "D")
